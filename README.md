Parts of dataset is changed!!!
 - Date attribute is removed due to its unnecessary
 - Time attribute is in excel format that cannot be used in python, so I used an excel equation
 to convert all Time to minutes (type interger). So please use the modified dataset (new_AirQualityUCI_changed.xlsx) for testing my code.

Optinal: You may take a look at "old_AirQualityUCI_changed.xlsx" to see which equation I used to convert Time format to minutes
